# codein_matrix_multiplication

About program:
The program compares the speed in seconds it takes for a matrix multiplication for an (n,n) matrix.
Random.randint is used to generate random integers to test the programs between numpy and python.
The result is then graphed using matplotlib.

Conclusion:
As clearly displayed through the graph with the same input size and data set numpy computation is faster than python.

Possible reasons for the above:

1) Numpy is a library designed for mathematical compution whereas python has more uses therefore making python slower as it
takes longer to analyse.

2) Numpy's funtions are written in C language which is faster than python as python requires an interpreter making it slower
to compute.
